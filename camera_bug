**Camera Problems**

   March 2, 2011. Matteo Benetti (MrBang)
	
	Booted my Hero with kernel builded on hero_defconf config file.
	Speed issue (cpu freq), bad screen on/off (power management).
	
	Try to take a photo and the frame stucks on screen. Even press
	"return" hw button and no response, only way to exit is 
	to press "home" hw button and activity was push underground. 
	While frame stucks on screen and after a lock/unlock procedure,
	camera backs to *work*.
	
	After some investigation i know  there are problem
	on AF (auto focus) procedure and with /proc/kmesg and the
	AF fails throws some I2C exceptions ("error during data xfer").
	Looked that if camera_settings->widescreen option is enable the
	zoom works bad. (When zoom is max there are many artefacts on screen.
	
	To repeat the *fail* situation, open camera app and enable AF option.
	With ADB shell command "cat /proc/kmesg", looking to log outputs 
	while camera is pointed somewhere.
	
	Ex. kmesg output:
		
	|	msm_open_common: open control0
	|	msm_i2c msm_i2c.0: error, status 43c8
	|	msm_i2c msm_i2c.0: Error during data xfer c (-5)
	|	i2c_transfer_retry: try 1/20: i2c_transfer sent: -5, len 1
	|	msm_i2c msm_i2c.0: error, status c8
	
	My opinion is there are some bugs about i2c driver maybe caused
	by missing header and/or minor porting errors.

	Into drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-msm.c from legend there is an include 
	that isn't into cm-kernel:

		#include <linux/i2c-msm.h>

	than added include above but the header missed so 
	imported it from legend kernel. 
	Building fails 'cause a method into system.h was bad.
	The system.h was different from old .29 and legend .35
	Than corrected mach/system.h and rebuild cm-kernel.
	Another error during build process. 
	The i2c-msm.c call kzalloc() and kfree() implicit declarate functions.
	Corrected error by including include/slab.h into i2c.c file.

	Now while taking a photo the app crashes and quit, so no long
	stucking frame on screen and unresponive terminal.

	i2c problems are caused as I disabled the AF acuator earlier.
	It seems with disabling this device, it is sometimes able to take a picture.
	However disabling it, also disables the focusing a little.
	I have reverted the driver totally to act like the original .29 HTC Hero drv
	
	The problem seems to be somekind of timing problem or so?
	Another possible lead is that it reports the gain and/or line is zero?
	Getting quite clueless actually...

	Camera is stable when using the default frequencies.
	However changing them (or the governor) leads to problems.
	We are now able to use preview mode, take videos and the AF sharper seems
	to work properly. However the important part: taking the picture fails.
